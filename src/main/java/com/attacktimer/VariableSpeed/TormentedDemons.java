/**
 * TormentedDemons is the variable speed implementation for the "punish" attack a player can do against a
 * demon.
 *
 * https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tormented_Demon/Strategies#Fire_bombs_and_shield
 * > Within this moment of vulnerability, attacking the demon using crush weapons, heavy ranged weapons
 * > (crossbows and ballistae), or casting a spell (not from a powered staff) increases all damage dealt by
 * > X2âˆ’16, where X is the weapon's attack speed. The attack speed for this one attack is set to 4 ticks
 * > (2.4s); if multiple demons are attacking, the attack speed decreases by one tick per additional demon
 * > that is fighting the player.
 *
 * This class works by keeping a map which tracks every demon that the client is provided, then if any demon
 * triggers a spot animation matching the vulnerability animation then we store this in the map. Every attack
 * the parent {@see VariableSpeed} will call apply, in which if we are attacking a vulnerable demon we can do
 * extra checks and compute the new attack speed and show the correct tick countdown.
